# OOD Contribution Guide
This guide is meant to help anyone interested in learning the OOD eco-system and understanding the various pieces that make up OOD and how they fit together with the goal of becoming a contributor, developer or even long term, a maintainer.

This guide was originally created and used for the initial GOOD Contributor Jam.
